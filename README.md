## Overview

This repository focuses on the study of immune gene family evolution. It includes workflows and analyses for understanding gene family expansions, contractions, and evolutionary patterns.

### Tools Used
- **CAFE**: A tool for analyzing gene family evolution by modeling gene gain and loss.
- **HyPhy**: A platform for hypothesis testing using phylogenies, often applied to evolutionary rate studies.
